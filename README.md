# HigherOrLower
Given a randomly shuffled deck of cards, this program tells the probability that the next card chosen is a higher or lower rank than the card currently in hand. The user clicks on each card that has been drawn from the deck, and the program keeps track of which cards are left in the deck to be chosen.
